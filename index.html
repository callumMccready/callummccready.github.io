							<h2>Skills</h2>
							<p>Here is a small handful of the various skills I possess. I have selected these specific skills as I deemed them to be most useful for the roles I am aiming for with this portfolio or because they are achievements that I am extremely proud of:</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>C++</h3>
									<p>I have completed many programs using C++. I can show a deep understanding and can lay my code out effectively and in such a way that even lesser experienced programmers can easily read and decipher each aspect of my programs. For examples of some of my projects, please view my portfolio.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>OpenGL</h3>
									<p>During my second semester at University, I learned the basics to OpenGL and was able to use this knowledege to create a simple 3D game. I have continued to work on this and improve these skills.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>Python was the language that i first learned to code in. I believe I have a rather adept knowledge of Python and have even produced a few simple games using the language. If you would like to see a game, in which I punch my college teacher in the face, to demonstrate my Python knowledge, please feel free to get in contact.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Film Production</h3>
									<p>Although this has little to do with games programming, it is a skill I am proud of and believe would prove beneficial to any game company I worked for. I have experience as an actor acting in various professional films and adverts. I also have experience producing films and have had the honour of working along side 2 Oscar winning directors and actors to produce and direct my own film.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>2019 Young Engineer Of The Year</h3>
									<p>Personally, it is one of my greatest achievements and so I have decided to include it. In 2019, Me along with a group of 3 others had the honour of being named the Midlands young engineers of the year and were due to continue to the national engineering exhibition held at the NEC in Birmingham before it was cancelled due to covid.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>IT Technician</h3>
									<p>I have spent a number of years working as a contractor for various companies’ IT departments. I decided to include this skill just to show that my Computational knowledge doesn’t just stop at Games programming, but I have a deeper understanding of the machines we have allowed to invade our lives and that we now depend entirely upon.</p>
